# Java Maze Algorithms

This repository contains a Java implementation of a maze generator and solver. The program utilizes iterative and recursive solutions to generate and solve mazes using different algorithms. It is designed as part of the ICS4UE (AP Computer Science 12) assignment.

## Features

- **Iterative and Recursive Solutions**: Implements both iterative and recursive methods for maze generation and solving.
- **Algorithms**:
  - **Brute Force Algorithm**: Backtracking Algorithm
  - **Greedy Algorithm**: Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Visualizer**: Provides a graphical visualization of the maze and the solving process.

## Algorithms

### Brute Force Algorithm: Backtracking

The backtracking algorithm explores all possible paths in the maze, marking visited paths and backtracking when a dead end is encountered.

### Greedy Algorithm: Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the start to the end of the maze, prioritizing paths with the least cost.

## Usage

### Running the Program

1. **Compile the Java files**: Ensure all `.java` files are compiled.
   ```bash
   javac *.java


Designed for Recursion Assignment of ICS4UE (AP Computer Science 12)
